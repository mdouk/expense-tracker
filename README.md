- **Projects Collection**: Stores project metadata (name, creator, timestamp).
- **Expenses Collection**: Stores individual transaction records linked to a `projectId`.

### Component Structure
- **App (Root)**: Handles Routing (Dashboard vs Project View), Auth State, and Data Subscription.
  - **Navbar**: Global navigation, user profile, and sign-out.
  - **Dashboard View**: Displays the list of projects and grand totals.
  - **Project View**: Detailed view of a selected project with tabs for transactions and analysis.
  - **Modals**:
    - `isProjectModalOpen`: For creating new projects.
    - `isFormOpen`: For adding new expenses.
  - **Reusable Components**:
    - `Card`: A styled container for projects.
    - `Modal`: A generic wrapper for popup interactions.
